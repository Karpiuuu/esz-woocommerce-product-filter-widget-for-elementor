# WooCommerce Product Filter Widget for Elementor - Fix Documentation

## Issue: Incorrect Multiple Category Filtering

### Problem Description
When filtering products by selecting multiple categories (e.g., `Nike` and `Men`), the filter incorrectly displayed products that belonged to only one of the selected categories (e.g., `New Balance` and `Men`), rather than showing only products that contained all selected categories.

### Root Cause
The issue was in the `tax_query` construction in the `eszlwcf_filter_product_args_ajax` method. When multiple terms were selected for the same taxonomy (like product categories), the query was using the default WordPress behavior, which displays products that match **any** of the selected categories rather than **all** of them.

### Solution
We modified the `tax_query` parameters to use the `'AND'` operator instead of the default `'IN'` operator for taxonomy queries. This ensures that products must match **all** selected terms within the same taxonomy.

## Code Changes
With the `'operator' => 'AND'` setting, the plugin now correctly filters products to show only those that belong to **all selected categories**.

```php
<?php
// Dodaj zapytania taksonomiczne
foreach ($taxonomy_terms as $taxonomy => $terms) {
    $tax_query[] = [
        'taxonomy' => $taxonomy,
        'field' => 'slug',
        'terms' => $terms,
        'operator' => 'AND', // To zapewnia, Å¼e produkt ma WSZYSTKIE wybrane kategorie
    ];
}
```

### Implementation Details
- Taxonomy terms are now properly grouped by taxonomy type.
- The operator is explicitly set to `'AND'` to ensure products match all selected terms.
- The `tax_query` array is merged with an `'AND'` relation to maintain consistency with other filters.
- This ensures that when multiple categories are selected, **only** products belonging to **all selected categories** will be displayed.

## How to Test the Fix
1. Select multiple categories in the filter widget (e.g., `Nike` and `Men`).
2. Verify that only products belonging to **both** categories appear in the results.
3. Products belonging to only one of the selected categories (e.g., `New Balance` and `Men`) should no longer appear in the results.
